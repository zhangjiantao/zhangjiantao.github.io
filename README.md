Fusee Launcher, in a browser!

# Description
This is a port of [fusee-launcher](https://github.com/Qyriad/fusee-launcher) to JavaScript using WebUSB. This appears to work on Linux, Android (unrooted), macOS and Chrome OS. Windows support is still extremely unstable and it seems to only work sometimes.
Supported browsers are Edge, Chrome, Opera and Chrome for Android. You can check the WebUSB browser compatibility list [here](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webusb).
